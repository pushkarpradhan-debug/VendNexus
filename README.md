Multi‑agent AI system for vending machine business intelligence powered by Google Gemini.

## Overview
VendNexus”- A nexus of ai agents for vending machine.
VendNexus is a next generation ai-powered vending machine management platform that deploy a nexus of specialized ai agents that work autonomously. Each one has its own expertise.
In current time if you see in vending machine, you have to go and check what is billing, how much products are sold, no personalization we don’t know what should add or removed no recommendation, machine runs out of stock you don’t know every time you have to go physically and check what is situation and then place order, if any error occur we don’t even know that and wrong product can also be delivered, buttons are old poor quality and cause poor user experience after all, and our vending machine needs to updated with current technology which will enhance experience of both customer and owner of Vending machine.
So solving the problems we introduce you to Vendnexus ai,
And I think a multi agent system is best to solve this problem because they firstly make sure, they will make customer experience good and with time passes they will be more efficient, and make their learning with time capabilities will make sure that customers will have good experience. And on the owner side 90% of load will be handled by ai human or owner just needs to take imp decisions. All the workload will be handled by Ai systems.
So what is Vendnexus- So what features does when Nexus offer first is predictive inventory management AI agent forecast demand prevent stockouts recommend you your stock UPS according locations specific patterns
Secure multi payment ecosystem cashless transactions with fraud detection supporting UPI cards mobile wallets and QR codes
What are features offered by Vendnexus
Real time stock monitoring owner just asking AI he can monitor what items are in stock and what quantities they are available in on base of specific location it will recommend the stock UPS and it will provide alert when quantity is below certain limit so before that item is out of stock Owner can restock it
Owner can add product remove product from dashboard just by a click According to owner’s mind owner can adjust prices as well Just buy some clicks, our ai agent will give real time revenue and profit details and if owner asks our ai Will generate a bar chart as well providing a in-depth information and comparing the product’s sales
So it’s fully functional multi system AI agents working for vending machine and it’s not limited for one if owner we can comprise the 2-3 different vending machine and extract data from them and provide to the owner of vending machine.
In a wind Nexus platform for owner WE a google AI inbuilt as well so if he wants to search about his business and how to expand it so he can directly search it on Google with our AI which will give good and accurate answers for the business formations or any other general purpose owner is asking for.
We built a multi-agent vending machine system using simple and efficient tools. SQLite was used as the main memory to store products, prices, stock levels, and all transactions. Pandas helped read and display this data cleanly as Data Frames. Ipywidgets created an interactive customer interface with dropdowns, quantity selectors, and a buy button. Utility functions handled stock updates, transaction recording, and purchase logic. datetime added timestamps for summaries and analytics. Together, these components demonstrate core Code Labs concepts: data handling, state management, UI interactivity, and modular functions—combined to form a functional customer agent and the base of a complete multi-agent system.

What technology we primarily used are:
1)Python language for coding .
2)Kaggle notebook.
3)Data processing and analysis library: 1. pandas, NumPy.
4)AI/ML integration: google Gemini API.
5)Some adk and sdk .
6)For visualization matplot, seaborn.

Due to time limitations certains update and functions are not able to add in this VendNexus currently but if we had more time we had made this even good with sufficient technology, In when Nexus we had had added access to CCTV camera and analyze the CCTV camera footage and with AI capabilities it will notice if any malfunction happens or anyone tried for theft and in QuickTime it will provide alert to near police station and owner, We had made such a system According to the sales AI will adjust the price by itself and if stock is going to be out of stock it will go to the particular site or contact dad wholesaler by email humans just have to confirm the payment details send that email to the business person If he had more time for blind people or people which have certain limitations We plan to add a voice agent as well and definitely for normal people also it will enhance the experience And we had added multi language support as well so if any foreigner also tries to use it he can use it without any difficulty And we had made system even more great and UI and Dashboard we have enhanced it to a very great certain level and definitely we had a on our payments as well so no payment scam will happen.
